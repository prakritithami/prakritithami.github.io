I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Lund Univeristy](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/prakriti-thami) in Sweden, originally from Nepal. My primary research interests lies at the intersection of **market design** and **behavioral economics**. 

I have an MSc in Economics from Lund University, and a BA in Economics and Visual Arts from Brown University. Before pursuing graduate studies, I worked for several years, gaining experience in labor migration research, economic consulting, and project development.

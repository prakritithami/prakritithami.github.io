I am an Economist with a PhD from <a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/prakriti-thami" target="_blank">Lund University</a> in Sweden. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>market design</strong> and <strong>behavioral economics</strong>. My work explores how individual behavior, incentives, and institutional frameworks shape the allocation of scarce resources. To address these questions, I combine theoretical modeling with experimental and computational methods, aiming to translate theoretical insights into practical applications.

<p align="justify">I have an MSc in Economics from Lund University, and a BA in Economics and Visual Arts from Brown University. Before pursuing graduate studies, I worked for several years, gaining experience in labor migration research, economic consulting, and project development.</p>

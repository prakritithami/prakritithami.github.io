Multiple Pricing for Personal Assistance Services
======

Abstract: Third-party payers often reimburse health care providers based on prospectively set prices.
Although a key motivation of prospective payment is to contain costs, this paper shows that
this aspect crucially depends on the design of the pricing scheme due to the well-known in-
centives of patient selection (or “dumping”). This paper provides a general theoretical frame-
work where heterogeneous users are served by either private for-profit or public providers,
each paid an hourly compensation by a third-party payer. The private, but not the public
providers may select patients. It is demonstrated that this realistic feature of the model im-
plies that total costs depends on the number of prices. The features of the model is illustrated
using the Swedish system of personal assistance services as a motivating example. Numeri-
cal results show that marginal adjustments to the current uniform pricing scheme would lead
to substantial savings.

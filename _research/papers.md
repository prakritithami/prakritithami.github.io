Truth-Telling in a Priority Pricing Mechanism
======

Abstract: This paper examines the effects of truth-telling on expected aggregate consumer wel-
fare within a priority pricing (PP) mechanism. Traditional models typically assume
that individuals will invariably misrepresent private information if it maximizes their
payoff; however, a substantial body of evidence suggests otherwise. Considering this,
the expected aggregate consumer welfare of PP is compared to that of uniform pricing
schemes, using a model that accounts for truth-telling preferences. The findings indi-
cate that a threshold proportion of non-truthful, low-need agents must be surpassed
for PP to enhance welfare. This theoretical insight implies that implementing PP can
be advantageous in populations with a low propensity for truth-telling but may reduce
welfare in populations with a high propensity for truth-telling. This theory is tested
through a pre-registered, online, survey-based experiment. Although the anticipated
differential impact between high and low truth-telling groups was not observed, the
results provide valuable insights for policy considerations.

Multiple Pricing for Personal Assistance Services
======
With Tommy Andersson, Lina Maria Ellegård, Andreea Enache and Albin Erlansson

Abstract: Third-party payers often reimburse health care providers based on prospectively set prices.
Although a key motivation of prospective payment is to contain costs, this paper shows that
this aspect crucially depends on the design of the pricing scheme due to the well-known in-
centives of patient selection (or “dumping”). This paper provides a general theoretical frame-
work where heterogeneous users are served by either private for-profit or public providers,
each paid an hourly compensation by a third-party payer. The private, but not the public
providers may select patients. It is demonstrated that this realistic feature of the model im-
plies that total costs depends on the number of prices. The features of the model is illustrated
using the Swedish system of personal assistance services as a motivating example. Numeri-
cal results show that marginal adjustments to the current uniform pricing scheme would lead
to substantial savings.

Blood Supply Allocation: Trade-off Between Equity and Efficiency
======

Abstract: ABO blood type compatibility can be exploited to attain a more equitable allocation of blood supply across patients with differing blood types. However, in a steady state, pooling procedures that seek to equalize the proportion of patients that get treated across compatible blood types could have an adverse effect on the total flow rate of treated patients. To address this issue, in this paper I derive the criteria which would ensure an efficient allocation and prove that in pairwise iterative pooling procedures as long as this efficiency criteria is satisfied in each step in which blood types are pooled, the final allocation will not be inefficient.
